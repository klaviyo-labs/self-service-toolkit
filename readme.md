# Self Service Toolkit

This is a collection of tools for advanced Klaviyo users. They cover various usecases for prepping and importing data. They can also serve as examples to build off of and can be copied and modified as needed.

These tools can be run in your browser from Github pages [here](https://klaviyo-labs.github.io/self-service-toolkit/index.html).
